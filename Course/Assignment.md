Assignment 3
============

Come up with an idea for a game and and implement it in Processing. I suggest you use a game you are making for one of your other subjects on this course. For example a board game or card game. You must make *everything* yourself. Game design, Sprites (if you want to use sprites), audio and programming. I expect you do have to do some self directed learning on this project and include stuff you havent learned from me. In addition to submitting your game and demoing in the class I need each person to submit a short video tutorial (YouTube/Vimeo) on something new you learned while completing your assignment. This is worth a flat 15% of your mark for this assignment. You should use git to manage your code on the assignment    

Marking Scheme:
Video: 15% Complexity:30% Project management: 30% Visuals: 25%

Submission dates:
- 9 March - Short game design document and your git hub link
- 13 April Project submission and demos  (week after Easter). Submit git link & video link via Webcourses 

Rubric:

| Grade | Description |
| ------|-------------|
| First | A project that looks great. All the art and is 100% procedural or self drawn and looks beautiful. There a significant amount of clever animation or gameplay (if the project is a game). For example multiple "modes" or "screens". The assignment has lots of functionality. There is depth to the assignment. For example, progression and powerups. The code is organised into classes. There is a lot of novelty and originality. All the code is written by the you. You will have used PVectors, transforms and classes to create autonomous elements in the assignment. You will loading content from text files. You will have used git extensively. Everything works. > 40 git checkins|
| 2.1 | The project looks good. There is a some animation or gameplay. You put in a good effort. Some features may not be complete or entirely working. Probably no file IO, but there should be while loops, for loops if statements etc to control aspects of the assignment. 20-40 git checkins |
| 2.2 | The project looks so so, but is pretty basic. There should be some animation or gameplay but significant issues that you couldn't resolve. All the movement and animation code will be pretty basic for example colours changing each frame or movement controlled by variables that just update each frame. Little or no control code. There is not much code, maybe a page or two. Between 10 and 20 checkins |
| Pass | All code in one file. Around a hundred lines of code. Looks like it could have been completed in an hour or two. Mostly drawing code, little or no controling code. Little or no functionality. Lots of code acquired from other sources. < 10 checkins |
| Fail | Something very basic that looks like it could have been completed in an hour. Just drawing code, no control code. The assignment has no interactivity. Significant unaddressed technical problems. No git usage.  |


Assignment 2
============

Create a version of this classic game Simon in Processing. This is due on 26 January

You can go with a square board divided into 4 coloured segments, but the more cool stuff you include, the higher your mark will be. Rubrick to follow. YOu might like to use an ArrayList in your solution. These are like arrays, but have a different syntax for accessing elements and also you can add and remove elements from an arraylist, unlike an array.

Assignment 1
============
Create an animated Christmas card in Processing. You must make the Christmas for someone and give it to that person. 
Here are some examples of previous assignments that students have done:

[![Video](http://img.youtube.com/vi/wAEABphUJB8/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAEABphUJB8)

These should be demoed in the class on 8 December.

In your christmas card you should use:

- Procedural drawing (no sprites!)
- Variables
- The if statement
- Loops
- Methods
- Arrays

|30%         |20% |20%      |30%   |

Rubrick:

| Grade | Description |
| ------|-------------|
| First | Animation, loops, arrays and methods used extensively and correctly. Everything parameterised. Use of audio and fonts. Some simple interactivity such as a game. Use of keyboard, mouse or controller input. Music and fonts. Use of some advanced features of Processing we havent covered in class such as classes and libraries. 200+ lines of code|
| 2.1 | Lots of animation, loops and arrays. Methods. Also using audio and fonts. Little or no interactivity. Between 100 and 200 lines of code |
| 2.2 | No animation or simple back and forth type animation, use of loops, but no arrays. Some duplicated code that could be replaced by an array or a loop. Some methods, but no parameters instead using global variables (or no methods). Around 100 lines of code|
| Pass | No animation. No loops or arrays, just some simple drawing in the draw method, or some attempt at loops that doesnt work. 20-50 lines of code |
| Fail | Project won't compile or major issues. |
